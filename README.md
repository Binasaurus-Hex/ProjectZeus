This project that I will be working on when I have free time is a text-based, RPG type game with a PUBG twist.

**_What is PUBG?_ ** 
PUBG is a online multiplayer battle Royale game available on Mac, Windows, Android and iOS devices.

**_How do you play it?_ ** 
In PUBG, 100 players will be sent to a deserted island without any weapons. After you jump out of a plane you must venture on your own, play with one other friend or with other squad members to grab weapons scattered around the island.

Your aim is to kill every last player and be the last man standing or if you're playing with friends, be the last squad standing. At the end, if you do manage to survive, you will get a big chicken dinner for your friends to feast on! ..... OK not a real chicken dinner (sadly...I'm starving) but you will be rewarded with credits that you can spend on cases. Cases give you clothing items and weapon skins to customise your look when you play.

If anyone has any ideas that I can implement, change or remove, feel free to contact me :)

Thanks,
OfficialMuffin
