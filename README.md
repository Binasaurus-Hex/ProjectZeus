This project that I will be working on when I have free time is a text-based, RPG type game with a PUBG twist.
In case you have no idea what PUBG (PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds) is then I suggest you research first.

If anyone has any ideas that I can implement, feel free to contact me :)

Thanks,
OfficialMuffin
